# Tanveer Alam - Data Science Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Tanveer, I am on track to completing my degree in Data Science (MS. Data Science) from University of Arizona. I have developed a strong passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as a data scientist.

During my studies and work, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I have also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data scientist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
